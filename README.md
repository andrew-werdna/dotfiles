## Setting Up GH
Since I can never remember [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) I'm adding this here. See [this](https://gist.github.com/rbialek/1012262) helpful gist and don't forget  
```
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
chown $USER ~/.ssh/config
```

## Installing NodeJS
### I like the [n tool](https://github.com/tj/n)

## Installing Golang
